# Quest Starter

[Heroku link][heroku]

## Synopsis:

The Problem: I'm a Game Master for Dungeons and Dragons. I want to find out when my players are available and what games they think are coolest. 

So here's Quest Starter: a Doodle Clone that looks like Kickstarter. I sign up, make a game, and then write a survey. Anyone can look at my game and fill out my survey. Each game shows how many people are interested, and can see all the survey results. Scheduleing made easy, and I know who's bringing the chips!

## MVP

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Auth, Rewrite Readme  (~1 day)
Start up rails, make users, make auth, and re-figure out how this project is going to work and what my goals are. Third time's the charm, eh? At least my wireframes are mostly intact.

### Phase 2: Making Games, Viewing Games (~2 days)
Solidify the games model, write the views, be able to create and update games. Transition everything to backbone: hope she runs nice now.

### Phase 3: Surveys (~3 days)
This is either going to be suprisingly easy or an utter nightmare. In short: make the survey builder form. Each survey can have three(+?) types of input: schedule, fill-in-the-blank, and multiple-choice. Each survey needs a name slot. If a user is signed in, the survey is associeated with her, but you can also be anonymous.

### Phase 4: Survey Fill In and View (~1 days)
A user can visit the site, click on a game, and fill out the survey. Then the gm can view the survey, from a list of all the filled out surveys. The INTERESTED PLAYERS number on the game should go up for every unique visitor who fills out a survey.

### Phase 5: Survey Results Fancy Display (~2 days)
See the aggregate results for a survey. Has to be super awesome and easy to read.

### Phase 6: CSS (everything else)
YEEEESSSSSS LET'S MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
