# Quest Starter

## Synopsis:

The Problem: I'm a Game Master for Dungeons and Dragons. I want to find out when my players are available and what games they think are coolest. 

So here's Quest Starter: a Doodle Clone that looks like Kickstarter. I sign up, make a game, and then write a survey. Anyone can look at my game and fill out my survey. Each game shows how many people are interested, and can see all the survey results. Scheduleing made easy, and I know who's bringing the chips!

## MVP
