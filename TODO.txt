Todo list 2: Electric Boogaloo

redo the stupid color css
  make all the clicky things on ids, all the listeners
    make just purple and purple-on-hover

WHY IS NOTHING FADING IN???

http://localhost:3000/#games/undefined should redirect to a 404. or Home.
Or a this game doesn't exists page.


1. tabs up and down
  z position -1, go down height of tab. Maybe that will work.
  You'll need their position to be relative then.

2. Get rid of that delete button when in save mode.
  Either no text, or just rip it out.
    OH SHIT MAKE IT WIDTH 0 hahahahahaha
      and side padding I guess.

3. div display errors make it pretty on Comments

4. and on game form? fuck if I know
    It doesn't HAVE errors. Well fuck. Put those in.

5. New game isn't building the sidebar :c

6. delete game form stuff

7. Seed Data

8. I want to insert new comment views above, not below the last comment.
    Thinking about having each comment have a div for the next comment in it.
      When I attach the comment, I then erase the old div that it attached to.
        So only the new one is left.

DONE

  9. When and where tabs.
      Play with models.
      Migration.
      REDO game show and game mini show (and game form too!)
 11. Make it ALL screen size responsive.
        All font sizes will be in terms of vh or vw
        Most space filling divs should have their heights also scale.
 12. Make more things transparent. It looks nice.
 13. Make the background not jump.
 14. On Log out, zero out the logged in user ID
 15. If your name is short, top menu tab highlights wrong.
 16. Get everything as smooth as my loads on the tabs. Accomplished by adding a callback to get or fetch
      i think
