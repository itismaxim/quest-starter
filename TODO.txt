Todo list 2: Electric Boogaloo

 1. Reset the Database
 2. Oleg Hasn't Made Any Games instead of You Haven't Made Any Games
 3. And it looks pretty with a tinted background


 1. Followers is glitching on the form screen.
 2. Seed Data

BARE MINIMUM

  3. Posted Date on Updates (copy code from comments)
  4. Use divs to make the posted date appear on the right.
  5. Editing updates saves with new lines. Fix that.
  6. Fix the Tab issue
  7. Insert the comments and updates FROM THE TOP, instead of from the bottom.
      Gods I hope editing a comment won't fuck that up. Maybe post by date edited then?
  8. Redo the CSS. Round the corners, make the NEW UPDATE POST TITLE thing good looking instead of shit.
      You can keep content editable on the edit updates, but not on the post updates, k?

DONE

  9. When and where tabs.
      Play with models.
      Migration.
      REDO game show and game mini show (and game form too!)
 10. Copy code, let comments be editable.
 11. Make it ALL screen size responsive.
        All font sizes will be in terms of vh or vw
        Most space filling divs should have their heights also scale.
 12. Make more things transparent. It looks nice.
 13. Make the background not jump.
 14. Explain SOMEWHERE that a GM can delete ANYONE's updates, not just theres.
        Confused explanation in one of the thingies? In a game description?
          I've had some trolls so I a telling you: as the GM, I can delete ANYONE's comments. SO STOP PISSING ME OFF.
 15. Increase Text Size of Summary
