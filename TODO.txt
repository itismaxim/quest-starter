// This Problem Has Been Currently Solved
    Should I Make The Current User Fetched When You Log IN?
    Instead of having the name and the ID, get the ID, then fetch it
    So:
    QuestStarter.currentUser
    QuestStarter.currentUserID

From Line 15 in api/comments_controller
    # this expects a current_user to exist.
    # when an anon posts, it does not
    # I don't want to put user_id into the comment_params
    # maybe I can save it without it?
    # I can. For Anons. But for actual users, I need to input the user ID.
    # Darn it.
    # Easy Solution: Welp, no anon posters.
    # Good Solution: ???
    # Insane Solution: If no one is logged in
    # make the current user NULL who has user_id NULL
    # ALL ANON COMMENTS BELONG TO LORD NULL
    # ALL HAIL LORD NULL

  Lord Null is best user.
