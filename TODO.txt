Todo list 2: Electric Boogaloo

*Fix the readme.*

****Make a guest log in page.****
On log out, it redirects to home page, NOT login.
Game View: make the corners rounded.
No seriously fix the ordering of comments, that's stupid (Maybe make them get INSERTED bottom first?)
**Yeah, you need to make the new game screen better.**
  **Image needs to display when you pick one.**
  The image preview place in new game? Give it a default image. Games w/o an image will use it.
    Super beyond the pale optional goal: make it select randomly from a bunch of cool D&D pics
  Optional: make the edit game screen the shit
***Seed data. Lots of seed date.***
Prowl the list below and select any nessesary changes.

Put time back in? THat might be a good idea.


WHen You click Description, it smacks your window up, because your window is now further down then the screen.
Stop that.
  Simple way: define the bottom of the screen, on this page,
  as being one entire screen length below the options.
  Since you need to scroll up, it will never appear to jump.

Text Boxes don't have their default text re-appear when you mouse away if you didn;t type anything.

New comments don't appear up top.

When you upload a picture, it doesn't appear until you save. Make sure the preview image is there.


Fucking Pixel Perfect Tool Bar gaaaaah
  Button shifts everything left
  Oh fuck you broke it's thickness
  Button not quite high enough.

Change all the divs in game form to have spaces,
and all be the same color.

You click on one, it changes color. On focus I guess.

SUPER IMPORTANT
STYLE NEW GAME (MINIMUM)
  -edit: On clicking edit, when you hover over buttons,
         you get a special element over them:
         white text, almost opaque black background.

         clicking it adds conenteditable="true"
         wherever you click.

         Clicking edit again saves all changes.

STYLE SEARCH (MINIMUM)


No Error Messages.
Needs to be orderable.
Style the new update. Thing.

Three Important Things Remain:s
  4. Search Results
  5. Get The Pictionary Thing Below
  6. Oh man oh man if you made the background's stretch the whole page and be overflow hidden it would do the cool thing.
  7. default: you haven't started games/ you haven't followed any games
  8. Seeds

Game Add Use Cloudinary
  make it pick a 3:4 aspect ration thing as a transformation.
    MWAHAHAHAHA JUST DO THIS RIGHT NOW YESSSS
    upload your own files onto cloudinary so you don't need to hotlink them
      - regular images first, then do the aspect ratio, then example pics.

Make the [Titles Of Games, Search Bar, Title-Input] Display in an ALL CAPS font.
Make the games controller ALL CAP the query string.

Navbar Dropdown - Make it slide. Use Jquery ui.

Hey mate: MOAR SEED DATA

Make A 404 Page. Well, two.

// Make The User and Session AALLLL Backbone.

// Optional: Make A Second Error CallBack Method That Just SPits Out
// Derpy Hooves and I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG

// Where and When Fields for games?

// Maaaaaybe I should take the router init in ROOT and transfer it
// to the app general template? Get my nav bar on the log in page!

// Make A Mark Up Thing For The Input, only for comments, updates, and descriptions.

// Got free time? Give games an ord. That way you can display them by that.
// THen use JQuery UI to make them drag and dropable.
// Ooooh nice sorting.
//   Or just by date published. That would be good too.
//   Also think about the proper number of statuses.
