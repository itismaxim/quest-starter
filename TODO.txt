Todo list 2: Electric Boogaloo

1. Reset the Database
2. Seed Data

BARE MINIMUM

3. Posted Date on Updates (copy code from comments)
4. Use divs to make the posted date appear on the right.
5. Fix the Tab issue
6. Insert the comments and updates FROM THE TOP, instead of from the bottom.
      Gods I hope editing a comment won't fuck that up. Maybe post by date edited then?

DONE

7. When and where tabs.
      Play with models.
      Migration.
      REDO game show and game mini show (and game form too!)
8. Make it ALL screen size responsive.
        All font sizes will be in terms of vh or vw
        Most space filling divs should have their heights also scale.
9. Make more things transparent. It looks nice.
