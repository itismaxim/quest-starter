Not only I am inserting extra line breaks, they aren't even displaying

For every number from 0 or 1 to the length of this collection, get or fetch!

Okay so now it only shows YOUR Games
and
the link in the nav bar don't work?

 1. Followers is glitching on the form screen.
 1. Following a game makes you switch to the description tab? But only up top? What?
 2. Seed Data
 3. If your name is short, top menu tab highlights wrong.
      Always looked a little ugly. Wanna just turn that off?
 3. There are no updates for this game.

BARE MINIMUM

  3. Posted Date on Updates (copy code from comments)
  4. Use divs to make the posted date appear on the right.
  5. Editing updates saves with new lines. Fix that.
  7. Insert the comments and updates FROM THE TOP, instead of from the bottom.
      Gods I hope editing a comment won't fuck that up. Maybe post by date edited then?
  8. Redo the CSS. Round the corners, make the NEW UPDATE POST TITLE thing good looking instead of shit.
      You can keep content editable on the edit updates, but not on the post updates, k?

DONE

  9. When and where tabs.
      Play with models.
      Migration.
      REDO game show and game mini show (and game form too!)
 10. Copy code, let comments be editable.
 11. Make it ALL screen size responsive.
        All font sizes will be in terms of vh or vw
        Most space filling divs should have their heights also scale.
 12. Make more things transparent. It looks nice.
 13. Make the background not jump.
 14. On Log out, zero out the logged in user ID
