Todo list 2: Electric Boogaloo

â€¢ Dec 1 Seed Data
All Games Page

I can't make the comparator work.
I unshift, but it adds comments at the bottom.
  When I refresh the page, the collection gets remade, apparently in order.
So just put them in backwards. Clearly these things always come in the right order, so fuck it.

 3. Posted Date on Updates (copy code from comments)
 4. Use divs to make the posted date appear on the right.
10. Copy code, let comments be editable.

{"games":[
  {
    "id":1,
    "author_id":6,
    "author_name":"Hiring Guy",
    "title":"\n    My Cool Game\n  ",

    "description":"\n    Describe your game here. This is where you can get in depth and describe what system you want to run, what the setting will be, and what kind of characters the players will have. Feel free to add anything else!\n  ",

For every number from 0 or 1 to the length of this collection, get or fetch!



BARE MINIMUM

  7. Insert the comments and updates FROM THE TOP, instead of from the bottom.
      Gods I hope editing a comment won't fuck that up. Maybe post by date edited then?
  8. Redo the CSS. Round the corners, make the NEW UPDATE POST TITLE thing good looking instead of shit.
      You can keep content editable on the edit updates, but not on the post updates, k?

DONE

  8. Get rid of FORM, and consolidate it into show. You click edit and jquery switches the tags
      the show listener just takes car of everything.
  9. When and where tabs.
      Play with models.
      Migration.
      REDO game show and game mini show (and game form too!)
 11. Make it ALL screen size responsive.
        All font sizes will be in terms of vh or vw
        Most space filling divs should have their heights also scale.
 12. Make more things transparent. It looks nice.
 13. Make the background not jump.
 14. On Log out, zero out the logged in user ID
 15. If your name is short, top menu tab highlights wrong.
 16. Get everything as smooth as my loads on the tabs. Accomplished by adding a callback to get or fetch
      i think
