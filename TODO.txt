Display Errors
<div class="display-errors"></div>
    Hint: Most Functions take error callbacks.
      Shunt the regular functionality to a success callback instead.
    Super Hint: It should basically be
      the same bloody call back for all of them.
    GIGA HINT: If it doesn't, you can write one,
      and make all the views inherit from that.

Got free time? Give games an ord. That way you can display them by that.
THen use JQuery UI to make them drag and dropable.
Ooooh nice sorting.
  Or just by date published. That would be good too.
  Also think about the proper number of statues.

More Styling.
Invert the colors: White Nav Bar, Purple text
Divs stretch all the way across the screen.
