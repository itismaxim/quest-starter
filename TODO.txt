Todo list 2: Electric Boogaloo

User Show, My Games, Your Games, Give em the round tabs light blue treatment.
YOU MADE IT SHOW THE POSTED DATE! YES!
  Now add that to updates,
  and make it right justified
When you click 'Find Out How It Works' you can't UNclick it.

****Make a guest log in page.****
***Write the find out how it works screen***
On log out, it redirects to home page, NOT login.

No seriously fix the ordering of comments, that's stupid (Maybe make them get INSERTED bottom first?)
**Yeah, you need to make the new game screen better.**
  **Image needs to display when you pick one.**
  The image preview place in new game? Give it a default image. Games w/o an image will use it.
    Super beyond the pale optional goal: make it select randomly from a bunch of cool D&D pics
***Seed data. Lots of seed date.***
Prowl the list below and select any nessesary changes.

// Where and When Fields for games?

// Maaaaaybe I should take the router init in ROOT and transfer it
// to the app general template? Get my nav bar on the log in page!

Text Boxes don't have their default text re-appear when you mouse away if you didn;t type anything.

When you upload a picture, it doesn't appear until you save. Make sure the preview image is there.

Change all the divs in game form to have spaces,
and all be the same color.
  You click on one, it changes color. On focus I guess.

Default: you haven't started games/ you haven't followed any games

Game Add Use Cloudinary
  make it pick a 3:4 aspect ration thing as a transformation.
    MWAHAHAHAHA JUST DO THIS RIGHT NOW YESSSS
    upload your own files onto cloudinary so you don't need to hotlink them
      - regular images first, then do the aspect ratio, then example pics.
